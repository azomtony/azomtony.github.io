  I am Golam Azom, a dedicated computational chemist currently pursuing a PhD in Chemistry with a minor in Computer Science at Louisiana State University. My research is mainly focused on developing neural network based force-field for Graphene-Oxide liquid interface to enhance study at these complex interfces. I am also working on separation of organic contaminants and radionucleotide from water using molecular dynamics. Some notable skillset that I have obtained throughout my research career: 

  - Molecular Dynamics (MD)
  - Density Functional Theory (DFT)
  - Ab-initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD)
  - **DNNF** (Deep Neural Network Forcefield) for GO-liquid interface
  - Enhanced Sampling and free energy calculation
  - Solid-liuid Interfaces
  - Reactivity at interfaces
  - Constant potential simulation
  - Spectroscopies (vSFG)
  - Code development (Analysis using python)
  - Machine Learning (CNN, LSTM, Transformer)
  - Data Science
