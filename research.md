### 🧠 Deep Neural Network Force Field for GO–Water Interface

Developed a high-accuracy many-body neural network potential for modeling interfacial properties of graphene oxide in water, trained on quantum reference data.

---

### 🍸 Methanol–Graphene Oxide Interface

Used AIMD and DFT to explore structure and proton-coupled dynamics of methanol near GO surfaces. Analysis of hydrogen bonding, adsorption, and reactivity.

---

### 💧 Pollutant and Radionuclide Removal

Simulated interaction of PFOA, PFOS, and radionuclides (e.g., UO₂²⁺) with GO to evaluate adsorption mechanisms and selectivity in water remediation.

---

### ⚡ Constant Potential Simulations

Implemented `conp` and `ewald/electrode` methods in MD to simulate electrochemical bias and interfacial charge effects at GO–liquid boundaries.

---

### 📈 Spectroscopic Comparisons

Generated vibrational SFG spectra from MD simulations to directly compare structural motifs with experimental observations.
